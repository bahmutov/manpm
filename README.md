## Badge

If you module has API well-described in the README, and `manpm <text>` works well,
consider adding the following `manpm compatible` badge to your README. Here is the markdown
for both variants: words or unicode symbols

```
[![manpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/manpm-compatible-3399ff.svg)](https://github.com/bahmutov/manpm)
[![alternate](https://img.shields.io/badge/manpm-%E2%9C%93-3399ff.svg)](https://github.com/bahmutov/manpm)
```

## Install

    npm install -g manpm

## Show the entire README from a package or github repo

You can give NPM package name (like `manpm`), GitHub user / repo pair (like `bahmutov/manpm`) or
full GitHub url (like `https://github.com/bahmutov/object-fitter` or `git@github.com:bahmutov/object-fitter.git`).

    manpm <package name | github repo>

For example `manpm email-regex` will render the README from
[email-regex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-regex) package in you terminal

![manpm screenshot](images/manpm-screenshot.png)

## Show part of the readme

    manpm <package name> [optional search text inside README]

If search text is provided, only a section of the README file with that text
(if found) will be displayed.

![manpm search section](images/search-section.png)

The following search features are implemented

- [x] find exact match in the section heading text
- [ ] fuzzy text match in the section heading text
- [x] find exact match in the section body
- [ ] fuzzy text match in the section body

I am still looking for a library capable of fuzzy text search.
Maybe [lunr](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js)?

## Show and search local README

Sometimes you just want to find a section in the local README file, right in the current directory.

    manpm . [optional search text]

## Example: showing ES6 docs

There is a great GitHub repo [ES6 Overview in 350 Bullet Points](https://github.com/bevacqua/es6)
hosted at `https://github.com/bevacqua/es6`. Let us see how we can info for `WeakSets`

```
$ manpm bevacqua/es6 weaksets
# WeakSets

    * WeakSet is sort of a cross-breed between Set and WeakMap
    * A WeakSet is a set that can't be iterated and doesn't have enumeration methods
    * WeakSet values must be reference types
    * WeakSet may be useful for a metadata table indicating whether a reference is actively in use or not
    * Read ES6 WeakSets in Depth (https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-weakmaps-sets-and-weaksets-in-depth#es6-weaksets)

<sup>(back to table of contents) (#table-of-contents)</sup>
```

I added an alias to `manpm bevacqua/es6` command to my shell alias file for convenience

    $ echo 'alias es6-docs="manpm bevacqua/es6"' >> ~/.alias
    source ~/.alias
    es6-docs weaksets
    es6-docs array

## Example: showing ES6 features

Another great succint overview of ES6 features is
in [lukehoban/es6features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features). Let us add an alias

    echo 'alias es6-features="manpm lukehoban/es6features"' >> ~/.alias
    source ~/.alias

Let us look up the binary notation in ES6

    es6-features binary
    ### Binary and Octal Literals
    Two new numeric literal forms are added for binary (b) and octal (o).
        0b111110111 === 503 // true
        0o767 === 503 // true

## Pipe through less | more

You can pipe the output of `manpm` through "less" or "more" tools - but you will
lose the Markdown highlighting.

    manpm <package name> | less
    manpm <package name> | more

## Advanced

If there are problems and `manpm` is not working as expected, you can see the debug output.
Just run the tool with `DEBUG=manpm manpm ...` environment setting.

    $ DEBUG=manpm manpm object-fitter
    manpm fetching README for package +0ms object-fitter

Good testing commands:

    DEBUG=manpm npm run example-es6-docs

## Inspired by the following tools

* [man-n](https://github.com/man-n/man-n)
* [npm-man](https://github.com/eush77/npm-man)
* [readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readme)

I wanted something a little more API friendly, like finding and showing
a README section that talked about a specific API method for example.
